# Seerr Integration

Search, request, and discover media directly from Jellyfin using your Seerr instance.

![Seerr search results](../images/jellyseerr.png)

!!! info "Note"

    **This plugin is NOT affiliated with Seerr.** Seerr is an independent project. This plugin simply integrates with it to enhance the Jellyfin experience.

    **Please report any issues with this plugin to the Jellyfin Enhanced repository, not to the Seerr team.**

## Features

- **Search + Request** - Search + request from Seerr, directly from Jellyfin search results
    - **Advanced requests** *(requires configuration)*
    - **4K Requests**
    - **4K TV Requests**
    - **Season selection**

- **Requests Tab**
    - **View request status** - pending, approved, available
- **Recommendations + Discovery** - Recommendations and similar items on detail pages
- **Issue Reporting** - Report problems directly to Seerr
- **Watchlist Sync** - Auto-add requested media to Jellyfin watchlist *([requires the KefinTweaks plugin](https://github.com/ranaldsgift/KefinTweaks)*)


!!! tip "How it works"

    To ensure security and prevent CORS errors, the plugin uses the Jellyfin server as a proxy. This keeps your Seerr API key safe and avoids browser security issues.


### Search Integration

#### Requesting:

1. Type search query in Jellyfin search bar
2. Results from both Jellyfin and Seerr appear
3. Seerr results show request status
4. Click to request or view details

#### 4K TV Requesting:

1. Enable **4K TV Requests** in plugin settings.
2. For TV results, use the request split-button dropdown and choose **Request in 4K**.
3. The season selection modal opens in 4K mode.
4. The modal header shows **Request Series - 4K** and the primary button shows **Request in 4K**.

!!! tip

    In More Info modal, TV actions use **Request More** as the primary action, with **Request in 4K** in the dropdown when 4K is requestable.

#### Request Status Indicators:

- **Available** - Already in your library
- **Pending Approval** - Request submitted, awaiting admin approval
- **Requested** - Request approved, waiting to be downloaded
- **Processing** - Actively downloading
- **Declined** - Request was declined by an admin
- **Not Requested** - Click to request

### Parental-Rating Filtering

Hide Seerr search and discovery results a user could not watch once requested,
based on that user's own Jellyfin content-rating restriction. This keeps a
child account on a PG limit from ever seeing (or requesting) an R-rated title.

Filtering happens **server-side**: restricted titles are removed from the
response before it reaches the browser, so they can't be recovered by
inspecting network traffic — a client-side hide would only conceal the cards.

#### Behavior

- Uses each user's own **Maximum Parental Rating** and **Block unrated items**
  settings from their Jellyfin account (Dashboard → Users → *user* → Access).
  Nothing is duplicated in the plugin — Jellyfin remains the single source of
  truth for what each user may watch.
- Applies to search results, discovery rows (genre/network/keyword/studio),
  similar/recommended sections, collections, watchlists, person filmographies
  (including the films listed under a person), and the requests list.
- A restricted user also cannot **open** a blocked title's detail/season or
  **request** it by id — both are rejected server-side, not just hidden.
- A title's certification is read the same way the More Info modal shows it
  (region → US → first available), using your **Default Region** (Elsewhere
  setting) to choose the certification system.
- **Administrators are never filtered**, and **users with no rating limit set
  see everything** — matching how Jellyfin treats parental controls for the
  library. `adult` titles are always hidden from restricted users.

#### Configure

1. Enable **"Respect parental ratings"** in Seerr search settings (on by default).
2. Set each restricted user's **Maximum Parental Rating** (and, optionally,
   **Block unrated items**) in their Jellyfin account. Users with no limit are
   unaffected.

!!! note "Limitations"

    - **Tag-based restrictions don't apply.** Jellyfin's blocked/allowed *tag*
      rules can't be evaluated against Seerr results because those titles aren't
      in your library yet and carry no Jellyfin tags. Only the rating limit and
      block-unrated settings are enforced.
    - **Unrated titles** (no certification on TMDB) follow the user's
      **Block unrated items** setting, exactly as in the library.
    - Certifications are fetched per title and cached (see
      [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration)); the first search that
      surfaces a new title for a restricted user is slightly slower.

3. Select issue type
4. For TV: Select season and episode (optional)
5. Enter description
6. Submit report

!!! note

    Issue reporting button will be hidden, if these are true:

    * Seerr is not reachable
    * User is not linked

## Requests Page

![Seerr requests page showing pending, approved, and available requests](../images/seerr-requests-page.png)

Monitor active downloads from Sonarr/Radarr and manage Seerr requests and issues in one dedicated page.

### Setup

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Plugins** → **Jellyfin Enhanced**
2. Navigate to **Seerr Settings** tab
3. Check **"Enable Requests Page"**
4. Optionally check **"Show Downloads in Requests Page"** to display active *arr downloads (enabled by default)
5. Optionally check **"Show Seerr Issues Section"** to display Seerr issues
6. Configure polling settings (see below)
7. Click **Save**

Once enabled, the Requests page is delivered through the unified [Navigation Pages](../enhanced/enhanced-features.md#navigation-pages) framework: it appears automatically wherever your layout keeps its library links (the AppBar action tray on modern desktop, the drawer on mobile, or the legacy sidebar), can be reordered per-user, and can optionally be surfaced through the Plugin Pages plugin with a single global toggle.

!!! note "You only need one data source"
    The Requests Page draws from two **independent** sources and is useful with either one:

    - **Downloads** come from your ***arr** services — a single **Sonarr *or* Radarr** instance is enough. A movie-only setup with just Radarr (or a TV-only setup with just Sonarr) works fine; the other service is not required.
    - **Requests and issues** come from **Seerr**.

    Configure whichever you use. You do **not** need to set up Sonarr, Radarr and Seerr all at once — any one of them enables the page.

### Polling Settings

### Icon States

When on the search page, a Seerr icon indicates connection status.

| **Icon** | **State** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
|<img alt="active" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/svg/seerr.svg" style="width:30px;height:50px;filter:drop-shadow(2px 2px 6px #000);" /> | **Active** | Seerr is successfully connected, and the current Jellyfin user is correctly linked to a Seerr user. <br> Results from Seerr will load along with Jellyfin and requests can be made. |
| <img alt="noaccess" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/svg/seerr.svg" style="width:30px;height:50px;filter:hue-rotate(125deg) brightness(100%);" /> | **User Not Found** | Seerr is successfully connected, but the current Jellyfin user is not linked to a Seerr account. <br>If plugin auto import is enabled, linking will be attempted automatically. If disabled, import users manually in Seerr. Results will not load until linked. |
| <img alt="offline" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/svg/seerr.svg" style="width:30px;height:50px;filter:grayscale(1);opacity:.8;" /> | **Offline** | The plugin could not connect to any of the configured Seerr URLs. <br> Check your plugin settings and ensure Seerr is running and accessible. Results will not load. |


## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Icon Shows Offline:**

1. Verify Seerr URL is correct and accessible
2. Check Seerr is running
3. Test connection in plugin settings
4. Check server logs for errors

**Icon Shows User Not Found:**

1. Verify "Enable Jellyfin Sign-In" is enabled in Seerr
2. If plugin auto import is enabled, run **Import Users Now** from Jellyfin plugin settings
3. If plugin auto import is disabled, import Jellyfin user manually in Seerr
4. Ensure the user is not selected in the **Blocked users** list
5. Ensure same username in both systems

### Search Not Working

**No Results Appearing:**

1. Check icon status (must be green/active)
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test API endpoints manually

**Results Slow to Load:**

1. Use internal Seerr URL
2. Check network latency
3. Verify Seerr performance
4. Check server resources

### Request Issues

**Cannot Make Requests:**

1. Verify user has request permissions in Seerr
2. Check request limits not exceeded
3. Ensure item not already requested
4. Check Seerr logs

**Requests Not Appearing:**

1. Refresh Seerr page
2. Check request was successful (no errors)
3. Verify user permissions
4. Check Seerr request queue

### TMDB API Issues

If reviews, elsewhere, or Seerr icons not working:

- TMDB API may be blocked in your region
- Check [Seerr troubleshooting](https://docs.seerr.dev/troubleshooting#tmdb-failed-to-retrievefetch-xxx)
- Use VPN or proxy if needed
- Contact ISP about API access

## Advanced Configuration

### URL Mappings

Jellyfin and Seerr URLs can be mapped. This changes the Seerr URLs displayed to users, depending on which URL that access Jellyfin

Useful for mapping Seerr URLs to Jellyfin URls, for **local access** (LAN) and **remote access**

```text title="Formatting"
jellyfin_url|seerr_url
```

!!! example "Examples"

    === "Remote access"

        ```text
        https://jellyfin.mydomain.com|https://seerr.mydomain.com
        ```

    === "Local access"

        ```text
        http://192.168.1.10:8096|http://192.168.1.10:5055
        ```

    === "Remote access + Local access"

        ```text
        https://jellyfin.mydomain.com|https://seerr.mydomain.com
        http://192.168.1.10:8096|http://192.168.1.10:5055
        ```

    === "Using base URLs + paths"

        ```text
        https://example.com/jellyfin|https://example.com/seerr
        ```

### Auto-Request Settings

Automatically request media based on viewing behavior.

#### Auto Season Request:

- Trigger when X episodes remaining in season
- Require all episodes watched (optional)
- Configurable threshold

#### Auto Movie Request:

- Trigger on playback start
- Trigger after X minutes watched
- Check release date (only request if released)

### Caching

- **Response Cache TTL** — how long Seerr search/discovery responses are cached
  (default 10 minutes).
- **Parental Rating Cache TTL** — how long a title's resolved content rating is
  cached for the [parental-rating filter](#parental-rating-filtering). Ratings
  rarely change, so this is long by default (1440 minutes = 24 hours) and shared
  across all users, keeping the filter cheap after the first lookup of a title.
- Both caches are flushed automatically whenever plugin settings are saved.
